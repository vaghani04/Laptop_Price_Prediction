# Laptop Price Prediction using streamlit

The "Laptop Price Prediction" project is designed to predict the price of a laptop based on various features such as brand, RAM, storage type, and more. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to create a predictive model and deploys it through a Streamlit application, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to input laptop specifications and get price predictions

The overall project contains several steps
1. Data Collection and Preparation
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Development
4. Model Evaluation
5. Streamlit Application Development
6. Set Up the Streamlit Interface
7. Create Input Fields for Laptop Specifications
8. Load and Apply the Predictive Model
9. Display the Predicted Price
